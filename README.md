## Project Description

We are WeRobot and create a world where life is easier. The idea behind WeRobot is to enter a specific market to support the industries which are suffering from the demographic change of the aging workforce with our technical expertise in automatization and digitalization.

---

## Questions

To expand our expertise in those markets in which the digital transformation didn´t take place yet, we were asking us following questions: 

1. In which countries in the European Union are the highest percentage of workers above 50?

2. Which industry in those countries have more workers above 50 than workers below 50?

3. How many people are we able to support in this industry and country with our expertise, as a base for further calculation?
