- Detailed explanation of your approach and code for constructing visualisations and organising them into a Story:
	1) I started by plotting conditions vs. waiting time, so we could quickly see which conditions were taking longer to be addressed; I connected gender and age group to this so we could have a nice overview of the female/male and age ratio inside each condition.
	2) I went to investigate which hospital units (neighbourhoods) were having longer waiting times, and if that was somehow resulting in more no-shows on the appointments.
	3) Finally I went to investigate a bit more on the scholarship: if patients with it were actually showing up or not (not goof spending government money for anything), and who were these patients, how many days they were waiting for an appointment, and if they had received a warning message or not.

- Results:
	> (see above/see plots on workbook)

- Obstacles encountered:
	> Working in general with tableau... it's not very flexible. I end up not fully understanding how to work around with 
calculated fields and parameters so end up not using them.
	> Shifting from pandas (matplolib and seaborn) to tableau in general. The data cleaning and manipulation has to go in a different way.
	> Not being able to perform correlations. They might be possible for sure but is something that was so immediate and useful in pandas...

- Lessons learned:
	> Work in group, not matter out.
	> I think brushing is on point.

- Link to your completed Tableau workbook:
	> I uploaded the complete workbook. Couldn't login to my tableau account for some reason.
